# Tribal — Claude Configuration

## Project Overview
Workspace containing the HC1 project (`./HC1`), tracked at https://github.com/ChristianSAW/HC1.

## Key Directories
- `HC1/` — main project repository

## Workflow Preferences
- Confirm before pushing to remote branches
- Confirm before force-push or destructive git operations
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Code Style
- Keep solutions minimal and focused; avoid over-engineering
- No docstrings, comments, or type annotations added to unchanged code
- No backwards-compatibility shims for removed code

## Notes
- This workspace root is not itself a git repository; HC1 has its own git repo
